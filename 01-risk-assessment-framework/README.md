# Risk Assessment Framework 🔍

> The foundation of any successful TPRM program is a well-structured assessment process that scales.

## The Assessment Lifecycle

Think of vendor risk assessments like a funnel; organizations need to catch everything that matters while filtering out noise efficiently.

📥 Project Intake → 🔍 Triage → 📋 Assessment → 📊 Analysis → ✅ Decision

### 1. Project Intake: The First Line of Defense

**The Reality:** Not every vendor relationship needs the same scrutiny. I've seen organizations waste countless hours assessing low-risk relationships while missing critical ones.

**What Works in Practice:**
- **Automated triggers** based on data sensitivity, access requirements, or technology type
- **Clear criteria** for what requires security review
- **Smart routing** to appropriate teams based on project characteristics

**🎯 Key Insight:** The best intake process is invisible to the business user but catches everything that matters.

### 2. Triage: Work Smarter, Not Harder

This is where organizations typically separate simple purchases from complex technology implementations.

**Common Assessment Criteria I've Seen:**

✅ Simple/Fast Track Items Typically Include:

No OS, no network, no data storage,
Physical items without compute capability,
Standard peripherals.

⚠️ Standard Review Usually Required For:

Network connectivity,
Data processing/storage,
User authentication,
Third-party integrations.

🚨 Deep Dive Often Needed For:

AI/ML components,
Medical devices with patient interaction,
Complex applications and systems,
Offshore data processing,
Payment processing.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Organizations that create clear decision trees empower their stakeholders to self-identify risk levels, saving everyone time.

### 3. Asset Classification: Know What You're Protecting

Every organization structures their assessment approach differently. Based on my experience in healthcare environments, here's a typical pattern:

#### 📋 Common Assessment Types

Organizations often start with broad categories like:
- **Medical/Clinical Device Assessments** - For physical clinical equipment
- **Application/System Assessments** - For software, infrastructure, and everything else

**But here's what I've learned:** These initial assessments are just the beginning. They're diagnostic tools that uncover what else needs evaluation.

#### 🔍 The Cascade Effect

Initial assessments frequently reveal additional areas requiring specialized review:

Initial Discovery → Additional Assessment Needed
━
AI/ML capabilities → AI-specific evaluation
Privacy concerns → Privacy impact assessment
EHR integration → Environment-specific review
Clinical interfaces → Interface security review
Offshore processing → Data residency evaluation

**💡 Hypothetical Example:** 
Imagine a "simple" cardiac monitoring device. The initial submission might only mention the bedside unit. But experienced analysts know to dig deeper:

**The Investigation Process:**
- **Analyst's Question:** "How does the data get from the device to the physician?"
- **Initial Response from business user:** "It just collects data"
- **Follow-up:** "But how do doctors access the readings?"

Through persistent inquiry and respectful dialogue, the full architecture often emerges:
1. The monitor connects to a tablet device
2. The tablet syncs to a cloud platform
3. The cloud platform uses AI for anomaly detection

This discovery would typically trigger multiple assessment types for each component.

**Lesson learned:** Trust your instincts. If the data flow seems incomplete, it probably is.

#### 🎯 The Universal Principle

Regardless of specific organizational tools:

**Start broad, then dig deep where needed.**

Effective assessments are discovery mechanisms. The skill is in:
- Asking questions that reveal hidden complexities
- Knowing when to engage specialized assessments
- Keeping the process efficient yet thorough

**⚠️ Common Pitfall:** Vendors may not recognize certain capabilities as requiring disclosure. They might not consider their "smart alerts" as AI, for instance.

#### 🔐 Remote Access: A Universal Concern

In my experience, it's best practice for organizations embed remote access requirements directly into their standard risk assessments if they can support it using their own remote support tool and NOT use a vendor managed tool or VPN. A typical approach might include:

**Standard Remote Access Evaluation Flow:**
1. **Initial Question:** "Is remote access required?"
   - If No → Continue assessment
   - If Yes → Proceed to requirements

2. **Follow-up:** "Can you use our standard remote access solution?"
   - If Yes → Provide requirements
   - If No → Evaluate alternatives

3. **Alternative Evaluation:** Organizations typically either:
   - Require use of their standard solution
   - Offer on-site support as the only alternative

This streamlined approach eliminates lengthy negotiations while maintaining security standards.

### 4. Stakeholder Mapping: Your Success Network

🏢 Business Owner
↓ (defines need)
📊 Project Manager
↓ (coordinates)
🤝 Relationship Manager
↓ (facilitates)
🛡️ Risk Analyst
↔ (risk review)
🏭 Vendor

**Key Insight:** Relationship managers who understand both business needs and security requirements are invaluable partners.

## 🎭 Hypothetical Scenario

**Challenge:** Consider a new MRI system implementation in a healthcare setting.

**Typical Discovery Process:**
1. **Initial assessment** reveals standard imaging device
2. **Risk questionnaire uncovers:**
   - AI-enhanced image processing
   - Local server requirements
   - Missing endpoint protection
   - Non-standard remote access requests
   - Extended patching cycles

**Common Resolution Approach:**
- **Remote Access:** Vendor agrees to standard organizational tools
- **Security Gaps:** Implementation of compensating controls (e.g., application whitelisting)
- **Patching:** Alignment with regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA recommendations)
- **Result:** Conditional approval with agreed upon security controls

**Industry Impact:** When organizations maintain high standards, vendors often improve their baseline security for all customers. I am proud to know that I have personally contributed to this ideal, creating a net positive in the world, one assessment at a time.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways Risk Analysts

1. **"I understand the 'why' behind processes."** Demonstrate how proper intake and triage save resources while catching real risks.

2. **"I balance security with business enablement."** Show examples where you found creative solutions rather than just saying no.

3. **"I can communicate effectively across all levels."** From technical discussions with vendors to executive risk summaries.
